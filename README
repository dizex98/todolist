* Start with getting all up by running the following commands:
    1) cd ./todolist/terraform
    2) terraform apply
    * all should be up after 15-20 min approximately
* After the waiting, in order to connect to the cluster run the following command:
    - aws eks update-kubeconfig --name itay-cluster --region eu-central-1
* Afterwards, you'll need to change the ip on the noip site:
    1) kubectl get svc/nginx-ing-nginx-ingress-controller
    * copy the external IP
    2) nslookup $external_ip
    - You can use one of them on site.
* Finally, you can enter to the domain http://itayportfolio.ddns.net

Jenkins:

- cd ~/Desktop/portfolio/
- docker-compose up --build -d
* Applying the webhook trigger:
    - run the command: ngrok http 8080
    - Update the url on the github same as on the "Forwarding" line. (for example https://1008-77-137-66-29.eu.ngrok.io)
